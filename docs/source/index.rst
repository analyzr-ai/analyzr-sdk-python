Welcome to Analyzr Python SDK's documentation!
==============================================

This Python client will give you access to the Analyzr API from any machine.
See sample Jupyter notebooks in the `examples` folder in the `repo <https://github.com/analyzr-ai/analyzr-sdk-python/>`_
for examples showing how to use the client.
Note that a `client_id` should always be provided when querying the API; it is
used for reporting purposes.
For additional documentation and support see https://support.analyzr.ai.
